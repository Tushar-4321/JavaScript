/*JS few years(ex = 8yrs)back was different it didn't had class, modules, arrow function but new Js had it, so JS Community or organization didn't want their old code to be useless as we are new code as many things were already written in old format, and when we are writing new code, it should be treated via new code standard,
as all gonna run in same engine
SO FOR THIS WE USE == "use strict";  // it will treat all code as newer version of javascript
*/
"use strict";//treat all code as newer version
//alert(3 + 3 ) //we are using nodejs not browser, allowed in browser it shows 6

console.log(3+3)
// always try to make code readability high

let name = "Tushar"//string datatype
let age = 25 //number
let iSLoggedIn = true // boolean

/* various dataTypes of JS are 
number --> range to 2 to power of 53
bigint  -- for large number
string ==> ""
boolean ==> true/false
null ==> standalone value(empty)
undefined ==> value not assigned
symbol ==> uniquness

object

console.log(typeof null);// null is object (shown in output) not a type// but comes in category of dataType
